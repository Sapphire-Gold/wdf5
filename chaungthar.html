<h1 id="up">Chaung Thar</h1>
<p class="intro">Of the three main beach resorts on Myanmar’s Bay of Bengal coast, Chaung Tha is the most down to earth, and you can find the largest number of locals on holiday here.

The beach lacks the white-sand perfection of Ngapali and Ngwe Saung, but it has several offshore islands to explore and snorkel around, and offers the same delicious rangeof fresh seafood as its more exclusive rivals (Chaung Tha is the same distance from Yangon by road as Ngwe Saung, and you can travel between the two beaches by motorbike along a coastal track).</p>

<p class="paragraph1">Chaungtha (Burmese: ချောင်းသာ) is a town and beach resort located in Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar. Chaungtha Beach, as it is more commonly known, is about 5 hours' drive away from Yangon, and is a popular resort with Yangonites from October to April.As it is relatively more affordable than the nearby Ngwesaung and Ngapali beaches, Chaungtha is also more crowded and less clean than the two more expensive and better maintained beaches.The beach is a must-see attraction in Pathein Township, Ayeyarwad Division, Myanmar and it's just 5 hours drive away from Yangon.</p>

	<h3>Attraction</h3>

	<img src="img/project4/beach4.jpg" width="450px" height="270px" class="imgc"/><img src="img/project4/beach5.jpg" width="500px" height="270px" class="imgd"/><img src="img/project4/beach3.jpg" width="370px" height="270px" class="imge"/>

	<p class="paragraph2">Chaungtha is renowned for its fresh and reasonably priced seafood. A major attraction is a small pagoda built on a limestone boulder at the southern end of the beach. Nearby fishing villages and tidal mangrove forests are also popular among the tourists. It's a nice beach that you can enjoy in an affordable way. There are many activities such as horse riding, bicycle and quad bike hire, inflatable rings and speed boat riding. It's very lively, but a bit crowed with stalls selling souvenirs, fresh seafood and beverages. On the other hand, we were very happy to swim in the sea, but the most disappointing thing is that some trashes were floating. Moreover, a smaller Sand and Rock Island can be seen on the horizon from the main beach and to our surprise, it cost only about 3 dollars. Great ops and prayed at a small pagoda there.
In addition, I'd recommend to stay in a hotel near the beach, so can go to the beach easily and can feel the breathtaking views from hotel even though the hotels near the beach are more expensive than the ones further from the beach. We wrapped our day by walking along the beach and going to the Buddha image on the small rock. And, the sunset and lightening views are absolutely stunning. Took hundreds of photos.
Besides, you can travel to Ngwe Saung Beach from Chaung Tha Beach by motorbike along a coastal track.</p>

	<h3>Accommodation</h3>

	<img src="img/project4/hotel1.jpg" width="500px" height="300px" class="imgf" /><img src="img/project4/hotel3.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" class="imgg" /><img src="img/project4/hotel2.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" class="imgh"/>

	<p class="paragraph3">Accommodation in Myanmar can be made to fit most budgets. Prices here are given in US dollars for simplicity, but all hotels will accept Myanmar kyat (the preferred currency depends on the hotel). Here is what you can expect for your money:

Budget accommodation can start from as little as $5 per night, going up to around $40. This may be a simple family-run guest house or small hotel, providing basic rooms and sometimes shared washing facilities. At the bottom end of the budget level, you may not always find air conditioning, 24 hour electricity or hot water; in some remote parts of the country you may be provided with a bucket to wash yourself with, rather than a shower.

There are few hostels in Myanmar of the type you would find in countries such as Thailand, although some are beginning to spring up in Yangon. Regardless, you will likely find friendly groups of like-minded travellers at budget hotels and guest houses in popular spots around the country.

Mid-range accommodation occupies the $40 to $120 price range. Here, you will find something more spacious with generally higher standards, and almost always offering 24 hour electricity, air conditioning and your own bathroom.

Luxury accommodation starts at $120 per night, and can go up to $400 for high-end hotels in Yangon or top tourist spots. These provide the standard high-end facilities you would expect, usually including 24-hour concierge and room service, laundry, and free internet. At the top end, you will find true luxury and style, with beautifully appointed hotels that are match for any in neighbouring countries.</p>
